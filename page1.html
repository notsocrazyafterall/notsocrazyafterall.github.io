                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Thank you for taking the time to read this very important message. In the town of Penetanguishene, Ontario there is a maximum-security mental institution called waypoint where countless, harmless, innocent people are being fraudulently detained, wrongfully medicated, and forced to live in a facility designed to hold some of the dangerous people in Canada. The reason this is happening is because A) It is extremely lucrative for the hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to do so, and B) There have been no precautions put in place to deter this from happening. These large corporations have taken advantage of the fact that nobody will take these patients seriously and used it as an opportunity to capitalize on their suffering. What's even scarier is that the government has granted, places like Waypoint, permission to violate even the most basic human rights, which has subjected these patients to merciless physical, emotional, sexual, and psychological abuse. The hospitals then use any psychotic reaction a patient might have, to said abuse, as grounds to demand enormous amounts of money from the government for alleged mental health treatment. The patients have been trying to communicate this to authorities for decades but nobody will take them seriously because the patients are both A) Assumed to be mentally ill and B) Heavily sedated, thus unable to articulate themselves properly. We, at notsocrazyafterall, feel that allegations of abuse should always be taken seriously and that all Canadian citizens are entitled to their constitutional rights. It is our goal to ensure that said philosophy is embraced and implemented by everybody. Thank you for your time. May love and prosperity reign graciously upon you all 
<br>
<br>From, your friends at notsocrazyafterall.ca</p>
